# Console_Raymarching
This is a homework for my A2 CS course.

This program renders a 3D ball with raymarching method and output the image as ASCII characters. I am not importing thirdparties' packet, but for a faster render, you could apply multiprocess in main.py

remember to zoom out when checking the result, otherwise you could not see the ball.

have fun.
